## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Set up the following resources in your Supabase project:

#### Database Tables

Run the SQL commands found in `supabase_setup.sql` in the SQL Editor of your Supabase project.

#### Storage Bucket Setup

1. In the Supabase dashboard, navigate to the Storage section
2. Create a new bucket named "app_images"
3. Configure the bucket settings:
   - Enable "Public bucket" option (for image display)
   - Set appropriate RLS policies:
     - Allow authenticated users to upload
     - Allow users to update/delete their own files
     - Allow public read access

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Storage buckets **cannot** be created using the SQL script or client SDK with anon credentials. You must create them manually through the Supabase dashboard. See `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions on setting up the `app_images` bucket.
